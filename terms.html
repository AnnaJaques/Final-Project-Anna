		<h2 class="centerText termsHeading">Terms and Definitions</h2>
		<p class="term">Computer Hardware</p>
		<p class="definition">Sometimes confused with software, hardware is all of the touchable, buildable parts of the PC. There are several pieces of hardware that combine to make a PC function. Those parts will be explained in the 
			next several PC Hardware definitions.</p>
			<p class="term">Computer Software</p>
		<p class="definition">Software is all of the information and process stored inside the computer. These are programs, operating systems, processes, data, and more that you can't physically touch and manipulate. You need
			a computer, built with hardware, to reach the software stored inside the PC.</p>
		<p class="term">Central Processing Unit (CPU)</p>
		<p class="definition">The Central Processing Unit (or CPU) provides the computer with it's input/output (I/O) operations. A program specifies a job or task, and the processor sees to it that the job is completed and the
			results are output. They have been combined with graphics to display applications, images, and data in different ways, and are constantly creating inputs and outputs to provide the user with the software they are 
			trying to access. As soon as the PC is powered on, the CPU gets to work processing information and starting the operating system. Many of the newer processors today can handle hundreds of processes while still 
			maintaining impressive clock speeds. Typically, the number of cores that a processor has relates directly to how fast it performs.</p>
		<p class="term">Graphics Card (GPU)</p>
		<p class="definition">The graphics card is the graphics processing unit for the computer. It renders high-quality, powerful graphics for strenuous tasks such as rendering 3D graphics and videos, playing video games, and streaming 
			high-definition video. The graphics card was created to provide better graphics than any CPU integrated-graphics could ever produce. While the CPU handles all processes of the computer at fast speeds, the GPU works
			along side it to specifically accelerate the graphics. Together, they can create a very fast, beautiful display.</p>
		<p class="term">Motherboard (Mobo)</p>
		<p class="definition">This is the main circuit board in the computer. It provides communication between other parts of the computer. It houses the CPU, memory, GPU, and provides connectors for other peripherals. It
			can provide power to some of these components, which is talked more about in the Power Supply definition. The motherboard is an intricate circuit board with lots of metal pegs and conduits. If even one is damaged
			or lost, the whole computer will not work. This is one of the more fragile parts of the computer.</p>
		<p class="term">Random-Access Memory (RAM)</p>
		<p class="definition">The computer's memory stores frequently used data items temporarity for fast access. The newest type of RAM is DDR4. Memory is written and read at the same time to maximize efficiency.</p>
		<p class="term">Power Supply</p>
		<p class="definition">The power supply is the power house of the cell... I'm just kidding, but, as it suggests, the power supply provides power to all of the PC hardware. It comes pre-installed with all of the cable-connectors
			necessary to plug in and power the different components. Fans, the GPU, the Mobo, and the Hard Drives require direct power. The CPU, Memory, and some fans can be powered by the motherboard, once the motherboard is supplied
			with power. Overall, without the power supply the PC would never turn on!</p>
		<p class="term">Hard Drives</p>
		<p class="definition">Hard drives are the storage devices for all computers. Hard Disk Drives (or HDDs) use a magnet and a disk (put simply) to store the information on the computer. 
			Operating systems, user data, the user's files, and more are stored on a hard drive. Solid State Drives (or SSDs) are an alternative, faster drive than an HDD. 
			They work without the need for a disk, storing data in circuit assemblies instead. They also tend to be more reliable long-term. M.2 drives are a smaller drive in the SSD family, 
			they are used mostly in laptops and small-build desktops. Many devices, like Chromebooks, are switching to cloud storage, and only have very small drives for the operating system but not for user files.</p>
		<p class="term">PC Case (or Tower)</p>
		<p class="definition">In desktop PCs, this is the housing for all of the PC components. They are usually made of a heat-dissipating metal and sometimes glass, and feature several fans for cooling the computer. 
			There are mounting brackets for the motherboard, while the power supply and hard drives typically sit in the bottom. They usually allow for easy cable management!</p>
		<p class="term">PC Fans or Coolers</p>
		<p class="definition">Fans or water coolers are built into all Desktop PCs and Laptops. They disperse heat throughout the computer and typically push hot air out with one fan and bring new, cool air in with another. 
			Water coolers are becoming more frequent, using a radiator and a cold liquid, inside of tubes, paired with fans to keep the CPU cool. Fans and water coolers often come with RBG capabilities in most Desktop PCs.</p>
